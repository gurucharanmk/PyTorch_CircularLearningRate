# PyTorch_CircularLearningRate

PyTorch implementation of circular learning rate for PyTorch model,as described in Leslie Smith's paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186

As paper says "Adaptive learning rates are fundamentally different from CLR policies, and CLR can be combined with adaptive learning rates, as shown in Section 4.1. In addition, CLR policies are computationally simpler than adaptive learning rates. CLR is likely most similar to the SGDR method [18] that appeared recently"

Implementation is in progress !!
